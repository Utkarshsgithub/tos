            <p style="margin-top:0;" class="story__para">Niall and Hugo met many moons ago in Liverpool at LIPA (The
                Paul McCartney fame school!) Although majoring in different fields, Niall in Acting and Hugo in
                Management, they very soon crossed paths. Both a little eccentric in their own way Hugo and Niall’s
                brainstorming sessions were regularly awash with many a whacky scheme. Niall is convinced they came
                up
                with the selfie-stick…! Upon graduating they started a theatre company and took Niall’s production
                of
                Macbeth to the Liverpool Everyman and then on to Scarborough and NSDF festival where it won the Best
                Play award.</p>
            <p class="story__para">Post NSDF their respective careers flourished, Niall carved a path out for himself in
                the acting business and Hugo an entrepreneur in the business community, taking full advantage of the
                “performing” background he experienced at Uni. The famous brainstorming sessions became more sporadic as
                “Life and Kids” came along but they kept on simmering in the background and over 20 years after they
                first met a “lightbulb” moment happened…</p>
            <p class="story__para">Niall had spent years flirting with the corporate sector in between acting jobs and
                had always been intrigued by the parallels between the Sales and the Acting world. Niall came to realise
                early on in his career how transferable his skill set as an actor was to the Sales world. The training
                he received at drama school and consequential professional nous garnered in rehearsal rooms and on set
                always gave him that extra boost when confronted with hunting, closing or account development. Niall
                mentioned this to Hugo</p>
            <p class="story__para"> <i>“Do you know we do the same thing?” Hugo said “we are both actors.
                </i> </p>
            <p class="story__para"> <i>“With our combined knowledge of the Acting and Business community, we could
                    create an acting schools for sales reps?” continued Niall.
                </i> </p>
            <p class="story__para"> <i>“Exactly” Hugo retorted with a smile…
                </i> </p>
            <p class="story__para"> <i>Thus “Theatre of Sales” was born.
                </i> </p>
